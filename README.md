# NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING
The entertainment industry is highly competitive, and success is dependent on various factors, including genre, rating, production budget, cast, and more. In this context, a study was conducted to understand the factors influencing the popularity of movies and TV shows on Netflix. The study used a dataset containing around 12 variables to cluster the movies and TV shows based on their popularity and audience preferences. The first step in the analysis involved data wrangling, where missing values were handled, and unique values were checked. The study identified that there were 2389 missing values for the 'director' column, 718 for the 'cast' column, 507 for the 'country' column, and 10 for the 'date_added' column. These missing values were removed by dropping the corresponding rows.

After understanding the data and getting variables, we first gathered and **cleaned the data, handled the null values** by checking the distribution and outliers in the data after that we have also typecasted the needed features into required format by **type casting** in order to visualize them properly. We performed indepth **EDA** and plotted different types of graphs by separating them into univariate, bivariate and multivariate categories as a result, We came accross some meaningful insights that helped us to make future decisions of ML model pipeline. Then further on, using **feature engineering** and data preprocessing  we have extracted new features like pulse_pressure and glucose_diabetes with the help of some features which are not directly impacting to tenYearCHD. We also tried to get some impacting features by removing **multicollinearity** within the independent variables with the help of **various inflation factor(VIF)**. In this dataset we have not **handled outliers** as removing them could potentially lead to a loss of important information and biased results.

According to the countplot, it appears that Netflix adds the highest number of movies and TV shows during the period between October and January. This period seems to be the busiest time of year for Netflix in terms of adding new content to its platform. Netflix has the highest number of content in the United States, followed by India. India has the highest number of movies on Netflix.

To cluster the shows, the study focused on six key attributes: director, cast, country, genre, rating, and description. These attributes were transformed into a 10,000-feature TFIDF vectorization, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was used to reduce the components to 3000, capturing more than 80% of the variance. Next, two clustering algorithms, **K-Means and Agglomerative clustering**, were used to group the shows. **K-Means** determined that the optimal number of clusters was 5, while **Agglomerative clustering suggested 7 clusters, which were visualized using a dendrogram**.

Finally, a content-based recommender system was created using the similarity matrix obtained through cosine similarity. This system provides personalized recommendations based on the type of show the user has watched, giving them 10 top-notch suggestions to explore. In summary, the study identified key trends in the Netflix dataset, including the growth rate of movies versus TV shows, the busiest period for adding new content, and the content demographics. Through clustering and a content-based recommender system, the study was able to provide personalized recommendations based on the user's viewing history. This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the popularity of movies and TV shows on Netflix, offering a foundation for further research and analysis
